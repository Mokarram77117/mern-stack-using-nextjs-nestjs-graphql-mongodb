## MERN Stack CRUD Operation Using NextJS NestJS GraphQL and MongoDB

This is a simple project as a beginner who are learning NextJS NestJS,GraphQL and MongoDB.
This project performs the operations of Create, Read, Update and Delete which is called CRUD operations.
There is also two extra features of uploading image and searching option.

## Used Technologies

**NextJS:** 
The React Framework for Production.
Next.js gives you the best developer experience with all the features you need for production: hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.
We used NextJS for the frontend part only in this project.

**NestJS:**
A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
We used NestJS in this project for the beckend part.

**GraphQL:**
GraphQL is a powerful query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. It's an elegant approach that solves many problems typically found with REST APIs.

**MongoDB:**
MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is used as an alternative to traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.

## Installation Instructions

First we need a code editor. I have used **VS Code**.
Then we need to install **node** and **git bash**
Then please follow the next steps.

1.Clone the project from github using this commad.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Mokarram77117/mern-stack-using-nextjs-nestjs-graphql-mongodb.git

3.Before running the project we have to create two indexes for "Name" field as text type and and title field as text type for searching user on users database on MongoDB.

4.Run the command for both client and server for installing node package manager
